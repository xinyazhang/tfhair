## Setup and Test
```
# Create venv directory for essential tensorflow support
# This only needs to be run by once
./bootstrap.sh
source venv/bin/activate # Enable python environment with tensorflow 
```

Now the unit tests can be started with ``./Rod/test.py``. There is no visual results by far, however.
